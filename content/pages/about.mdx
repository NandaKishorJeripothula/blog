Hi, I'm Paul Semel. I am a French computer engineer.
I studied computer science at [EPITA](https://epita.fr/) Paris, France, and obtained my Master's degree in 2019.

During my studies, I had the opportunity to learn general knowledge in computer science. Hopefuly, I had the opportunity to join a research laboratory, where I got
interested in very low level programming. In the meantime, I was also stuying algorithm and more high level programming (like how to do this website for example).
At some point, I also had the opportunity to understand how my school's infrastructure was working, and I learned a lot in infrastructure management.

I've had the opportunity to do some cool projects like:

* Writing a bash-like shell program
* Writing a dynamic linker for Linux ([LDSO](https://github.com/paulsemel/LDSO))
* Writing a 64 bits kernel with multiple features like : dynamic modules, paging, multiprocess...

During the last year of my studies, I had the opportunity to work on a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), where I had the chance to work
on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/). The objective of this "internship" was to improve **LLVM binutils**. I [wrote a post on the subject](/posts/llvm-gsoc/).

In the mean time, I had the opportunity to do internships. The first one I did was very interesting, as I was working in the hypervisor security team at Amazon A.W.S.
There, I was working on a microkernel called [XTF](http://xenbits.xenproject.org/docs/xtf/). The point of this project is to be able to tests security patches against
[Xen](https://xenproject.org/). I was mostly doing C and assembly.

Then, I had a six months internship at Apple, where I was working as a compiler engineer intern. The team I was part of is working on the backend part of LLVM. Back there,
I was working on bringing a solution to enable *profile guided optimization* in daily builds. I had the chance to work on the kernel (**Darwin**), but also to write a static
analyser based on LLVM.

Currently, I am looking for a job or an internship in New York, U.S.A. (or in this area). Do not hesitate to contact me on whatever social media you wish if you have any opportunity
that could interest me!

The purpose of this blog is to write on stuffs I am currently doing (even though I don't quite often find the time to write new posts...), and to share those with you!

-------------------------

The source code of this personnal blog is available [here](https://github.com/paulsemel/blog).

Of course, there is still a lot to do to improve global aspect of the blog, but I thought that it could be a small * **Gatsby** usage example* to get it open source.

-------------------------

Have fun!
